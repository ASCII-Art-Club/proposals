# Country Simulator

This proposal is a bit more open-ended and involves more design; and the game is fun.

Every turn, you choose a faction to make a descision on. Depending on what you choose, your popularity may rise or fall with many factions.
It may also change the strength of your rivals. (*optional feature*) You also have a balance of money. You have 100.000 in expenses each turn.

``` 
Oligarchs  XXXXXXXX
People     XXXXX
Opposition XXX
Police     XXXXXXX
Army       XXXX

Rivals     XXXXX
```

If you have more then ten crosses, then you gain money (20.000) for every cross above ten. (*optional feature, can be changed*)

If a faction's popularity with you drops to zero, they will attempt a coup. Many implementations options are available, including:
 - Option 1
   - Jail them, putting the faction out of play for 3 turn (-1 for all factions)
   - Pay them off
 - Option 2:
   - Start a war (requires strong army)
   - Pay them off (-2 for all factions)

If the treasury is empty, the options are:
 - You lose
 - You must negotiate with foreign nations to assist your country (*requires optional feature*)

If rivals become strong enough and there are enough factions with less than four crosses, a war may start.
